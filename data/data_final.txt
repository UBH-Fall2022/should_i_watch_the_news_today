paragraph : Tech companies start to feel the economic pain. The Fed is poised to announce another three-quarter point increase in its benchmark rate. The jobs report is coming.Elon Musk ushered Twitter into a new era on Thursday, completing a $44 billion deal to acquire the service. This outcome was hardly inevitable: Mr. MuskÆs bid in April to buy Twitter was followed by months of reversals and lawsuits that brought the two parties to the brink of a trial. But Mr. Musk met an Oct. 28 deadline set by a judge to carry out his purchase, and he immediately began cleaning house, firing at least four top executives. The swift cuts suggest that Mr. Musk is going to move quickly to carry out his vision ù and by taking Twitter private, the mercurial billionaire is not beholden to shareholders or required to make regular public disclosures as he does so. What he is planning to do remains somewhat hazy, but Mr. Musk has described himself as a ôfree speech absolutistö and said he would reverse the ban on former President Donald J. Trump from the platform. Mr. Trump said Thursday evening that he had been told his account would be restored on Monday.

paragraph : Americans are combining leisure and business travel. Tech profits are slowing. And the deadline for Elon Musk to buy Twitter is coming up.Investors did not have a strong reaction on Thursday to Liz TrussÆs announcement of her resignation as British prime minister. The pound edged only slightly higher, and bond yields briefly fell, then reversed course. It was, perhaps, an anticlimactic conclusion to Ms. TrussÆs six weeks in office, which were marked by big market swings in response to her corporate tax cut proposals ù plans she later reversed in the face of overwhelming backlash. But her exit doesnÆt necessarily mean the end of the tumult. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, has warned that despite the central bankÆs brief interventions to soothe markets, it will continue to raise interest rates to tame inflation. At the end of the month, Jeremy Hunt, the new finance minister, is set to present the governmentÆs fiscal statement, which he said would include ôdifficultö spending cuts. And sometime before then, the Conservative Party will appoint a new prime minister, who may have different ideas about taxes and government spending.

paragraph : But there will be some relief for the millions of people dependent on Social Security. And a report on how much the housing market is slowing.New inflation data on Thursday dashed any remaining hopes that the Federal Reserve might soon ease off its plans to continue aggressively raising interest rates. The Consumer Price Index showed overall inflation climbing 8.2 percent in the year through September ù a slight moderation from August but still uncomfortably high. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel costs, notably re-accelerated, running at 6.6 percent. The persistence of inflation in the face of the FedÆs policy moves may be frustrating, but it is not altogether surprising. Most economists expected the process of wrestling down rising prices and cooling off the economy to be slow ù though it is starting to seem that even small signs of progress are not cropping up where they should. And now some worry that as inflation becomes more entrenched it could lead to a wage-price spiral, a no-win feedback loop in which rising prices lead to wage increases that then reinforce inflation.

This time, it was to return to his initial proposition: buying Twitter at $54.20 a share. He had been trying for months to back out of the $44 billion deal, accusing Twitter of misleading him about the number of spam accounts on its platform. The dispute was set to be litigated in Delaware Chancery Court this month and promised to be a messy affair for both sides. More than a hundred subpoenas had dragged Silicon ValleyÆs elite into the litigation, and text messages sent among Mr. Musk and his friends and business associates emerged this month, revealing a clash between the billionaire and TwitterÆs leadership. But the tumult is not over. The judge overseeing the case granted a request from Mr. MuskÆs lawyers to delay the Delaware trial, giving him three weeks to complete the purchase, and, as with all things Musk, the situation could become more complicated still.

paragraph : Tech companies start to feel the economic pain. The Fed is poised to announce another three-quarter point increase in its benchmark rate. The jobs report is coming.Elon Musk ushered Twitter into a new era on Thursday, completing a $44 billion deal to acquire the service. This outcome was hardly inevitable: Mr. MuskÆs bid in April to buy Twitter was followed by months of reversals and lawsuits that brought the two parties to the brink of a trial.

The swift cuts suggest that Mr. Musk is going to move quickly to carry out his vision ù and by taking Twitter private, the mercurial billionaire is not beholden to shareholders or required to make regular public disclosures as he does so. What he is planning to do remains somewhat hazy, but Mr. Musk has described himself as a ôfree speech absolutistö and said he would reverse the ban on former President Donald J. Trump from the platform. Mr. Trump said Thursday evening that he had been told his account would be restored on Monday.

But her exit doesnÆt necessarily mean the end of the tumult. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, has warned that despite the central bankÆs brief interventions to soothe markets, it will continue to raise interest rates to tame inflation. At the end of the month, Jeremy Hunt, the new finance minister, is set to present the governmentÆs fiscal statement, which he said would include ôdifficultö spending cuts. And sometime before then, the Conservative Party will appoint a new prime minister, who may have different ideas about taxes and government spending.

paragraph : But there will be some relief for the millions of people dependent on Social Security. And a report on how much the housing market is slowing.New inflation data on Thursday dashed any remaining hopes that the Federal Reserve might soon ease off its plans to continue aggressively raising interest rates. The Consumer Price Index showed overall inflation climbing 8.2 percent in the year through September ù a slight moderation from August but still uncomfortably high. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel costs, notably re-accelerated, running at 6.6 percent. The persistence of inflation in the face of the FedÆs policy moves may be frustrating, but it is not altogether surprising. Most economists expected the process of wrestling down rising prices and cooling off the economy to be slow ù though it is starting to seem that even small signs of progress are not cropping up where they should. And now some worry that as inflation becomes more entrenched it could lead to a wage-price spiral, a no-win feedback loop in which rising prices lead to wage increases that then reinforce inflation.

This time, it was to return to his initial proposition: buying Twitter at $54.20 a share. He had been trying for months to back out of the $44 billion deal, accusing Twitter of misleading him about the number of spam accounts on its platform. The dispute was set to be litigated in Delaware Chancery Court this month and promised to be a messy affair for both sides. More than a hundred subpoenas had dragged Silicon ValleyÆs elite into the litigation, and text messages sent among Mr. Musk and his friends and business associates emerged this month, revealing a clash between the billionaire and TwitterÆs leadership. But the tumult is not over. The judge overseeing the case granted a request from Mr. MuskÆs lawyers to delay the Delaware trial, giving him three weeks to complete the purchase, and, as with all things Musk, the situation could become more complicated still.
